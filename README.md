# Introduction

This project contains code needed to train a model that would emulate a Pure Pursuit agent that drives a car in the `f1tenth_gym` environment.

Data collection and testing of the trained model is done in another repo, [this](https://github.com/MTDzi/f1tenth_gym) one.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MTDzi/offline_rl.git

cd ../offline_rl
python main.py
```
